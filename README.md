# Hello to the curious!

There's really nothing interesting to see here.  This project is just about me
personally coming up to speed in modern ES6-type Javascript because it's been
a few years since I did serious frontend development.

These examples are based on the O'Reilly book
[Learning Javascript, 3rd Edition](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-javascript-3rd/9781491914892).

I like cats.
